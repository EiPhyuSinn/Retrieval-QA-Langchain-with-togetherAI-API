# Mental Health FAQ Chatbot

A question-answering chatbot built using **LangChain**, **Together AI's Mistral LLM**, and **Gradio**.  
This project enables users to ask mental health-related questions and receive detailed answers extracted from a curated FAQ dataset.

## How It Works

1. **Data loading:** FAQ data is loaded from a CSV file.  
2. **Embedding:** Questions are embedded using HuggingFace embeddings.  
3. **Indexing:** Vectors are indexed with FAISS for fast retrieval.  
4. **RetrievalQA chain:** Uses LangChain to create a pipeline combining document retrieval and LLM answer generation with a custom prompt.  
5. **User Interface:** A Gradio interface lets users type questions and get answers from the chain.
